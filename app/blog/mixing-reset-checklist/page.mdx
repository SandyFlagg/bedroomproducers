# Mixing Reset Checklist - Simplify Your Mix Decisions

When your mix sounds muddy, cluttered, or just "off," it's time for a mixing reset. This checklist will help you get back on track.

## The Problem

Most bedroom producers struggle with:

- **Muddy low-end**: Too many elements competing in the bass frequencies
- **Cluttered mids**: Instruments fighting for the same frequency space
- **Harsh highs**: Over-processed or poorly EQ'd high frequencies
- **Poor balance**: Elements that are too loud or too quiet

## The Solution: Mixing Reset Checklist

### üéØ **Pre-Mix Setup**

- [ ] Set monitoring level to 85dB SPL
- [ ] Check room acoustics (move away from walls)
- [ ] Use reference tracks (3-5 similar songs)
- [ ] Save a backup of your project

### ü•Å **Drums First**

- [ ] Kick: Clear fundamental, no mud below 40Hz
- [ ] Snare: Punchy mid-range, not too bright
- [ ] Hats: Present but not harsh
- [ ] Overall: Drums sit well in the mix

### üé∏ **Bass Foundation**

- [ ] Bass: Clear fundamental, no mud
- [ ] Kick + Bass: No frequency conflicts
- [ ] Low-end: Tight and controlled
- [ ] Sub-bass: Present but not overwhelming

### üéµ **Melodic Elements**

- [ ] Lead: Clear and present
- [ ] Pads: Supportive, not competing
- [ ] Arps/Plucks: Defined but not harsh
- [ ] Vocals: Clear and intelligible

### üéöÔ∏è **Balance Check**

- [ ] Drums: Foundation level
- [ ] Bass: Supporting drums
- [ ] Melodic: Complementing rhythm
- [ ] Vocals: Clear and present

### üîß **Technical Check**

- [ ] No clipping on individual tracks
- [ ] No clipping on master bus
- [ ] Stereo image is balanced
- [ ] Mono compatibility check

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Print it out** or keep it open on a second screen
2. **Go through each section** systematically
3. **Check off items** as you complete them
4. **Don't skip steps** - each one matters
5. **Use it regularly** - make it part of your workflow

## Pro Tips

### Take Breaks

Your ears get fatigued. Take a 10-minute break every hour.

### Reference Constantly

Compare your mix to reference tracks every 15-20 minutes.

### Trust Your Ears

If something sounds wrong, it probably is. Don't ignore your instincts.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Solo mixing**: Always check how elements work together
‚ùå **Over-EQing**: Subtle changes are usually better
‚ùå **Ignoring phase**: Check mono compatibility
‚ùå **Rushing**: Good mixes take time
