### Don't Overthink It

The best flips are often the simplest. Focus on one strong idea and execute it well.

### Make It Yours

Don't just add a melody on top. Transform the groove, change the feel, make it uniquely yours.

### Pay Attention to Mixing

A great idea with poor mixing won't win. Make sure your track sounds professional.
